# Guides/assistance for Authenticated GeoMet datasets

This repository contains a collection of guides and tutorials for connecting to prediction products on the 
GeoMet platform (https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-geomet/readme_en/) that are currently protected by
authentication. At present these products are available as Web Map Service and Web Coverage Service layers. 

The files in this root folder of the repository are primarily Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the process to
access and display WMS and WCS prediction layers.
